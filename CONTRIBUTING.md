##How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need developers to help this project come to fruition.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and  check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)



## Pay for pull

We are using a "pay for pull" model for some of the issues in this repository. For issues labelled with a “Help Wanted” AND a “$ Amount" we will pay a flat dollar amount if we merge your contribution. 

Please read the [Rapid Adoption Guide](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/rapid-adoption/wiki) for everything you need to know to participate in a Pay for Pull.

For your pull request to be considered for payment, you must include a copy of the Terms completed with your information and a PayPal email link in the comments section of the of the pull request. Please read the Pay for Pull [Terms](https://github.com/bcgov/bc-laws-api/blob/master/Terms.txt). 

## Testing

Please write tests for new code you create using junit.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions below and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
